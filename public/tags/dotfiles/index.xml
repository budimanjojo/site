      <description>Introduction The biggest difference between my setup and your setup might be our configuration files. In Unix world we call them dotfiles. Dotfiles are just files whose filename starts with a dot and will be hidden by default in our file managers.
Usually we have several machines that we use consequently, and we want all those machines to share the same environment. And thatâ€™s why most most people will have have own collection of dotfiles stored somewhere so they can easily migrate them over to their new machine.</description>

      <description>Introduction Sometimes there are values that you want to use multiple times in your manifest files. Usually, we define them using a config map or secret and we either mount them as a file or environment variable. This is easy if you don’t use GitOps and you only have a small amount of pods. Also, having a single configmap and secret will clean up a lot of mess out of your cluster, and this is what variable substitution will do for you.</description>

      <description>Introduction Following my previous post about Kubernetes management using Flux, this post will cover secret management using SOPS and age. SOPS is a tool to encrypt and decrypt text files while age is the encryption tool that is simple, modern, and secure.
Reasons to Use SOPS and age Flux supports Sealed Secrets and SOPS as secret management, but I prefer SOPS for multiple reasons. You may or may not agree with me.</description>

      <description>Introduction GitOps is currently the most popular way to manage your services. It’s sort of what DevOps is but with Git. To put it in a simple way, it is a practice where you manage everything through git. Whatever you have in your git repository is what your cluster current state is. Because GitOps is so popular there are a lot of new tools focusing on GitOps right now, and Flux is one of them.</description>

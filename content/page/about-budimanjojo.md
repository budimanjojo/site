Welcome to my personal site! I'm a technology enthusiast that love Linux and opensource.
My name is Budiman and I live in Indonesia.
This is the place where I will be sharing about anything, mostly tech related.
I hope this site/blog can help people learning new stuffs and have fun.

This site is hosted in a [Cloudflare Page with Hugo](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-hugo-site/).
The search box above is powered by [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/).
If you can't find anything that means I have reached 10k requests monthly cap because I'm cheap and use the Free Plan.
Comment section is powered by [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) so I/you can read/reply comments on Github discussions too.

My current main focus is on Kubernetes and GitOps.
You can find more about my Kubernetes cluster in my [Github repository](https://github.com/budimanjojo/home-cluster).

Here are the list of my personal highlight that I want you to know:

- I use [neovim](https://neovim.io/) as my main text editor and I use vim keybindings as much as I can in other apps.
- ~~[I use Arch BTW](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/btw-i-use-arch)~~ I switched to NixOS in 2022 ðŸ˜ƒ.
- My current Kubernetes cluster runs on [Talos Linux](https://www.talos.dev/)
- My first program is [talhelper](https://github.com/budimanjojo/talhelper) which is a tool to GitOps Talos Linux written in Go.
- I live in CLI most of the time, you can visit my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/budimanjojo/dotfiles) for my config files.
- I love Classic Tetris, been watching it since the [Boom Tetris for Jeff era](https://tetrisinterest.com/boom-tetris-for-jeff/).

I think that's all I can say about myself.

**PS**: Remember to have fun!
